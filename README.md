Main features:

Load and process news article URLs

Split and embed the text using HuggingFace models

Store embeddings using FAISS for fast retrieval

Ask questions and get answers based on the article content

Simple user interface built with Streamlit


Technologies used:

LangChain

Streamlit

HuggingFace Embeddings

FAISS

Groq API or OpenAI (for the language model)
